Create a Flight Delay Model: Collect, clean, and preprocess data. Choose a model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks), train, evaluate, fine-tune, handle imbalanced data, deploy, monitor, update regularly. Optionally, design a user-friendly interface for end-users. Regular updates are crucial for accuracy amid.
