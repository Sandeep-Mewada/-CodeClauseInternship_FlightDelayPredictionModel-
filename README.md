# -CodeClauseInternship_FlightDelayPredictionModel-
Create a Flight Delay Model: Collect, clean, and preprocess data. Choose a model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks), train, evaluate, fine-tune, handle imbalanced data, deploy, monitor, update regularly. Optionally, design a user-friendly interface for end-users. Regular updates are crucial for accuracy amid.
Certainly! However, creating a complete Flight Delay Prediction Model involves multiple steps and requires various components, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Below is a simplified example using Python with popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Note that this is a basic example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements and dataset.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# Load your dataset
# Assuming you have a CSV file named 'flight_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing and feature engineering
# Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.

# Assuming 'DepDelay' is the target variable and other relevant features are selected
X = data[['Feature1', 'Feature2', '...']]
y = data['DepDelay']

# Encode categorical variables if needed
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
X['CategoricalColumn'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(X['CategoricalColumn'])

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Flight Delay Prediction Model (Random Forest as an example)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# You can also print other metrics or generate a classification report
# print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Save the model for future use
# You can use joblib or pickle to save the model
# import joblib
# joblib.dump(model, 'flight_delay_model.joblib')
```

Please replace 'flight_data.csv' with your actual dataset file and update the features accordingly. Additionally, fine-tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different models may be necessary to improve the model's performance.
